## 📝 **Comments — Quick & Clear Annotations in C++**

---

### 🎯 **Objective**

To understand how comments work in C++ and how they are used to make code more readable, maintainable, and self-documented.

---

### 📘 **Definition**

**Comments** are **non-executing text** written in the source code to explain, describe, or temporarily disable parts of the program.
They are ignored by the compiler.

---

### 🧩 **Types of Comments in C++**

| Type                    | Syntax               | Description                                            | When to Use                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-line Comment** | `// comment text`    | Used for short explanations or notes on a single line  | Quick reminders, inline notes               |
| **Multi-line Comment**  | `/* comment text */` | Used for detailed explanations spanning multiple lines | Describing blocks of logic or documentation |

---


### 💡 **Best Practices**

✅ Use comments to **explain purpose or reasoning**, not obvious actions.
✅ Keep them **clear, short, and updated** with code changes.
✅ Use meaningful variable names to reduce excessive commenting.
✅ Add **TODO**, **NOTE**, or **FIXME** tags for future reference.

### ⚠️ **Common Mistakes**

| Mistake ❌                    | Correction ✅                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `// increment x by 1`        | `// increase level count after each round` |
| Leaving outdated comments    | Always update comments when logic changes  |
| Over-commenting trivial code | Focus on logic or reasoning, not syntax    |

---

### 📘 **Real-Life Analogy**

* **Single-line comment** → a *sticky note* beside a line of code.
* **Multi-line comment** → a *notebook page* explaining a section of code.

---

### 🧠 **Conclusion**

Comments make your C++ code **readable, maintainable, and professional**.
Use them to clarify your logic, communicate intent, and assist anyone (including future you) in understanding the program efficiently.
