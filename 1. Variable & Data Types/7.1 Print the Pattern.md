### 🖨️ Explanation of the Output Statement

```cpp
cout << "****\n" "***\n" "**\n" "*\n";
```

- **`cout`**: Sends text to the output screen.
- **`"****\n"`**: Prints four stars, then `\n` moves to the next line.
- **`"***\n"`**: Prints three stars, then moves to the next line.
- **`"**\n"`**: Prints two stars, then moves to the next line.
- **`"*"`**: Prints one star.

All these strings are joined together and printed in sequence, creating a pattern:

```
****
***
**
*
```

**In summary:**  
This statement prints a descending pattern of stars, each on a new line, forming a simple triangle shape.
