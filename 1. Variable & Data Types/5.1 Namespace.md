### 🗂️ What is a Namespace in C++?

A **namespace** in C++ is like a labeled storage box 📦 where you keep your stuff organized so it doesn’t get mixed up with others’ stuff!

---

#### 🧩 Structure

```cpp
namespace myBox {
    int toy = 5;
    void play() {
        // ...play with toy...
    }
}
```

- **`namespace myBox { ... }`**  
  This creates a special box called `myBox` where you can store variables, functions, and more.

#### 🏠 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you and your friend both have a toy named "car" 🚗.  
If you just say "car," it’s confusing!  
But if you say "myBox::car" or "friendBox::car," everyone knows whose car you mean.

---

#### 🎯 Why Use Namespaces?

- Prevents name clashes (no mix-ups!).
- Keeps code organized.
- Makes teamwork easier.

---

#### 📝 Example

```cpp
namespace Alice {
    int age = 10;
}

namespace Bob {
    int age = 12;
}

cout << Alice::age; // 🧒 Alice's age
cout << Bob::age;   // 🧑 Bob's age
```

**Namespaces are your code’s way of keeping things tidy—like having your own labeled box at home! 🏷️**
