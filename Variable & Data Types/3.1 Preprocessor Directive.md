## Quick summary
This program prints the value of PI (3.1416) using a preprocessor macro. Output: 
Hello world: no — actual output: `3.1416` 📤

## Line-by-line (short & fun)  
- `#include <iostream>` 📥 — brings in input/output tools (cout).  
- `#define PI 3.1416` 🔖 — preprocessor macro: every `PI` is text-replaced with `3.1416` before compilation.  
- `using namespace std;` ➕ — lets you write `cout` instead of `std::cout`.  
- `cout<<PI<<endl;` 🖨️ — prints the numeric text that replaced `PI`, then new line.  

## What the preprocessor does (simple analogy) 🧾➡️🛠️
Think of `#define PI 3.1416` like a sticky label you put on a recipe that says “SUGAR = 3 spoons.” Before you start cooking, you copy that label everywhere the word SUGAR appears in the recipe. The preprocessor replaces the tag, so the actual cook (the compiler) only sees the final recipe with numbers — it never sees the label itself.

Steps:
1. Preprocessing: replace `PI` with `3.1416` (sticker copying) 🏷️  
2. Compilation: check syntax, convert to object code 🧠  
3. Linking: combine with library code 🔗  
4. Execution: program runs and prints `3.1416` ▶️

## Why prefer const/constexpr in real life? (safer & clearer) ⚠️➡️✅
Macros are blind text replacements — they can cause subtle bugs (like unexpected expansions). Using a typed constant is like putting the number in a locked jar labeled “PI” — safer and type-checked.

Suggested safer replacement:
````cpp
// ...existing code...
#include <iostream>
constexpr double PI = 3.1416;
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << PI << endl;

    return 0;
}
````

## Small tip 🎯
Use `constexpr` (or `const`) for constants in modern C++. Reserve `#define` for conditional compilation or header guards.
