This is a **"Hello World" program** - the classic first C++ program that demonstrates basic output functionality.

### Code Explanation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>      // Preprocessor directive - includes input/output stream library
using namespace std;     // Namespace declaration - allows direct use of cout, cin, etc.

int main()              // Main function - entry point of every C++ program
{
    cout<<"Hello World!"; // Output statement - prints "Hello World!" to console
    
    return 0;           // Return statement - indicates successful program termination
}
```

## How This Code Works in Your Machine:

### 1. **Preprocessing Phase**
- Preprocessor reads `#include <iostream>` and copies the entire iostream library code into your file
- `using namespace std;` is processed to allow direct access to standard library functions

### 2. **Compilation Phase**
- **Lexical Analysis**: Code is broken into tokens (keywords, operators, identifiers)
- **Syntax Analysis**: Compiler checks if code follows C++ grammar rules
- **Semantic Analysis**: Compiler verifies meaning (e.g., `cout` is properly declared)
- **Code Generation**: Compiler converts C++ code into machine language (assembly/object code)

### 3. **Linking Phase**
- Linker combines your object file with standard library files
- Resolves external references (like `cout` function implementation)
- Creates final executable file (.exe on Windows)

### 4. **Execution Phase**
- Operating system loads the .exe file into memory
- CPU executes instructions sequentially:
  1. Program starts at `main()` function
  2. `cout` sends "Hello World!" to output buffer
  3. Buffer contents are displayed on console
  4. `return 0` signals successful completion to OS

### **Output**: `Hello World!` appears on your screen

This simple program demonstrates the complete journey from source code to visible output on your machine!
